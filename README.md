# Student Performance Predictor

Welcome to the **Student Performance Predictor** project! This web application uses machine learning to predict a student's final grade based on their attendance, assignments, and test scores. The app employs a trained model to predict a letter grade ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F') based on these input features.

## Project Overview

This project predicts a student's final grade using a trained machine learning model. The grade prediction is based on three factors:
1. **Attendance**: Percentage of classes attended.
2. **Assignments**: Average score on assignments.
3. **Test Scores**: Final exam score.

The model uses these inputs to predict the student's final grade as a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F).

### Key Features:
- **Machine Learning**: Uses a machine learning model trained with data on attendance, assignments, and test scores.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Allows users to input data via a simple web form.
- **Predictive API**: Exposes an API endpoint to predict the grade based on the input data.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework for building the API.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for training the machine learning model.
- **Joblib**: For serializing the trained model.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the front-end interface.
- **Python**: For the backend logic and prediction.
- **Vercel**: (or another platform) for deployment.
